Hi, welcome to the LogPlan project.

If you want to add a user, go to the txtfiles folder, and add the name and ID of the new developer.
Do this in a comma-seperated form.

The application file is called App.java, and most features of the program is explained in the menus.

The data is saved in the txtfiles-folder upon exit, but only if you use the exit option through the application.
The data is loaded into the app upon startup, and if any of the files are in a different format as currently, you might get exceptions.
